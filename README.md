# Fraud Detection Project

## Introduction
The Fraud Detection Project aims to build a robust machine learning model to identify fraudulent transactions. This project leverages various machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection systems. The model is designed to be integrated into real-time decision-making pipelines to prevent fraudulent activities.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation using different algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Integration with real-time systems for practical use
- Visualization of results

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
